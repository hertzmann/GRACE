GRACE Tutorial</H2>
</CENTER><P>
This is a quick step-by-step of how to use GRACE to create a simple 
ruler compass construction, and a proof of it's correctness. The 
tutorial will demonstrate some of GRACE's basic features. In the first 
part of the tutorial, you will define the midpoint construction; in the 
second, you will prove the correctness of the construction. The latter 
parts of the tutorial introduce some of the more abstract concepts in 
GRACE. The tutorial will make the most sense if you follow the steps in 
order.</P>

    <A NAME="part1"><B>The main GRACE window</B><BR>
     The center of the main GRACE window is white drawing area, called the <B>Construction 
    area</B> where you will create the construction. You can make this 
    window larger by resizing the main GRACE window. (How you do this 
    depends on what system you are using.) The other parts of the GRACE 
    window will be explained later. </A>

    <A NAME="part1"><B>Place input points</B><BR>
     Click on the <EM>Place Points</EM> button at the lower left of the 
    window. Then click in the construction area once. A small box will 
    appear near where you clicked; this is an input point. Click again 
    somewhere else in the Construction area to place another input point. 
    The construction we define will find the point halfway between these 
    two points. </A>
    <P>
    </P>
    <LI>
    <A NAME="part1"><B>Place a line segment connecting the input points</B><BR>
     On the right side of the window is a list of construction primitives, 
    such as <EM>Circle</EM> and <EM>Line</EM>. Click on <EM>Line Segment</EM>, 
    and then click on one of the input points. It will turn magenta to 
    indicate that it is selected. Click on the second input point, and a 
    line segment will appear, connecting the two input points. </A>
    <P>
    </P>
    <LI>
    <A NAME="part1"><B>Place two circles</B><BR>
     Click on <EM>Circle</EM>. Click on each of the input points, and a 
    circle will appear in the Construction area. The first input point you 
    selected determines the center for this circle, and the second point is 
    a point on the circumference of the circle. Place another circle, by 
    clicking the inputs points in the opposite order. Now you should have 
    two circles, each centered at one of the input points. </A>

    <A NAME="part1"><B>Intersect the circles</B><BR>
     To find the intersection of the circles, click on <EM>Intersect</EM>, 
    and then click on each of the circles. A filled dot will appear at each 
    of the intersection points. These dots represent points like the input 
    points, except that they are determined by the steps of the 
    construction. You can apply primitives and constructions to input 
    points and to dependent points. </A>

     Place another line segment, this time between the two filled circles. 
    This line segment is the perpendicular bisector of the previous 
    segment. (There is also a perpendicular bisector primitive, which makes 
    the midpoint construction trivial, but for now we'll do it by the more 
    elaborate method.) Intersect these two line segments; the intersection 
    point is the midpoint. </A>

    <A NAME="part1"><B>Move the construction around</B><BR>
     Click on the <EM>Drag input</EM> button in the lower-left corner 
    of the GRACE window, and drag one of the input points around the 
    construction area. Notice that all other steps of the construction move 
    in order to maintain their original relationship with the input point, 
    and the midpoint is always halfway between the two input points. We'll 
    prove that this is the case in the second part of the tutorial. </A>

    <LI>
    <A NAME="part1"><B>Select outputs</B> <BR>
     Click on the <EM>Select outputs</EM> button and then select the 
    midpoint. This marks the midpoint as the sole output of the midpoint 
    construction. </A>

    <A NAME="part1"><B>Save the construction</B><BR>
     Select <EM>Name current...</EM> from the <EM>Construction</EM>
     menu and type in a name for this construction (such as 
    &quot;Midpoint&quot;) in the window that appears, and press <EM>OK</EM>. 
    The new construction will appear in the list of available 
    constructions, after the list of primitives.</A>

    <A NAME="part1">Now you can use the midpoint construction in other

    the <EM>Edit</EM> to clear the Construction area and start over. 
    Place two input points. Select the new construction, and apply it to 
    the two input points. The midpoint will appear between these two 
    points. When you apply the midpoint construction, GRACE internally goes 
    through each step of the construction, and then displays the output 
    shapes. (In this case, only the midpoint was output.) </A></P>

    that GRACE has given each shape a name. For instance, the input points 
    have been labelled P0 and P1. Select the <I>Text</I> option from 
    the <I>Windows</I> menu. The Text window shows a textual

    erased and all the steps of the midpoint construction reappear as if 
    they had just been entered. The contents of the Text window will also

     Clear the construction place a line and a line segment, and intersect 
    them. Select <I>Constraints</I> from the <I>Windows</I> menu. The 
    constraints window will appear, with three portions. The top portion, 
    representing input constraints is empty, since there are no 
    requirements on the inputs to the midpoint construction. The bottom 
    portion, &quot;Output constraints&quot;, is also empty because we have 
    not selected any constraints as outputs.</A>

    intersection point to the endpoints of the line segment is equal to the 
    length of the line segment; in other words, the intersection point lies 
    on the line segment. No corresponding constraint has been generated for

    <A NAME="part2"><B>Apply Side-Side-Side</B><BR>
     We can show that the triangle(P0,I4,I5) is congruent to the 
    triangle(P1,I4,I5). (This is because any two points on a circumference 
    of a circle are equidistant from the center of the circle. Automatic 
    constraints were generated based on this fact). Select &quot;Axiom - 
    SSS&quot; and select the vertices of the triangles, in the following 
    order: P0, I4, I5, P1, I4, I5. Note the new step in the Text window, 
    and the new constraints in the Constraint window. One of the new 
    constraints, <I>angle(P0,I4,I5) = angle(P1,I4,I5)</I>, will be used 
    implicitly in the next step.</A> 
    <P>

    <LI>
    <A NAME="part2"><B>Apply Side-Angle-Side</B><BR>
     Now we can prove that the triangle(P0,I4,I8) is congruent to the 
    triangle(P1,I4,I8). Note that the SAS axiom requires that <I>angle(P0,I4,I5) 
    = angle(P1,I4,I8)</I>, but the constraint proven in the previous 
    step used I8 instead of I5. This is not a problem, since GRACE treats 
    angle(P0,I4,I5) as identical to angle(P0,I4,I8). GRACE can infer this 
    equality because I5 and I8 must be collinear and on the same side of 
    I8. This inference is a consequence of the sidedness rules, which will 
    be discussed later.</A>

     Notice that one of the newly generated constraints, <I>dist(I8,P0)

    &quot;Create output&quot;, and click that constraint. It will be added 
    to the &quot;Output constraints&quot; portion of the window. Select <I>Name 
    current...</I> from the <I>Construction</I> menu to save the new 
    construction. Apply the new midpoint construction to some pair of 
    points, and notice that the output constraint has been added to the set

<A NAME="part3">Part Three: Angle Sum Axiom</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="part3">In this exercise, we will create an axiom which asserts 
that (1) the sum of two angles on a line is PI, and (2) an angle is 
equal to the sum of its parts. Axioms in GRACE are treated the same as 
theorems; we consider an axiom to be a theorem stated without proof.

    <A NAME="part3"><B>Make an assumption</B><BR>
     This axiom will require that the point P1 is on the line segment 
    between P0 and P2. To ensure this condition, we must create an input 
    constraint (also called an assumption) that asserts <I>dist(P0,P1)+dist(P1,P2) 
    = dist(P0,P2)</I>. Open the Expression window and select &quot;New 
    Distance.&quot; Select P0 and P1, then P1 and P2. Note that selecting 
    two distances, one right after the other, sets the expression to be the 
    sum of the distances. You can add as many distances as you want this 
    way. This action creates the expression on the left side of the 
    assumption. Select &quot;New Distance&quot; again and click P0 and P2. 
    This is the right side.</A> 
    <P>
    <A NAME="part3">Select &quot;Create input&quot; in the Constraint 
    window, and then click each of the two new expressions. The input 
    constraint will appear in the Constraint window. Note that the actual 
    positions of the points in the draw area do not have to match the 
    assumption; enforcing this requirement is a very difficult problem. 
    Instead, this assumption represents a symbolic relationship between the 
    points; <B>if</B> the points do meet the assumption, then anything 
    we prove based on the assumption will also be true.</A></P>

    of the expression as before and click &quot;Force intermediate.&quot; 
    Select the two new expressions. The constraint has now been forced - 
    GRACE accepts it without proof. Unlike Unlike an input constraint

    axiom with two endpoints of a line segment as the first and third
