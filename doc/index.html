<I><FONT SIZE="4">Welcome to GRACE, the Graphical Ruler and Compass
Editor.</FONT></I> GRACE is an interactive ruler and compass construction editor for use in teaching
the fundamental concepts of geometry to high school students. With
GRACE's intuitive graphical user interface, students can both define
geometric constructions, and create formal proofs about their
constructions. </P>
<P>
GRACE allows dynamic creation and modification of ruler and compass 
constructions, allowing students to easily visualize the steps of a 
construction and how it varies for different inputs. Constructions may 
be built from one of five geometric primitives (Line, Line Segment, 
Ray, Circle, Perpendicular Bisector, and Intersection), and from other 
constructions; thus constructions may be built by composing more basic 
constructions.</P>
<P>
GRACE's powerful proof system is based on equality constraints over 
angles and distances. The system automatically infers constraints from 
the geometric primitives and axioms applied by the student. The student 
may then make assertions about the construction, which will be 
automatically verified by the system, so it is <I>impossible to prove a 
false assertion within GRACE. </I>(The exception to this occurs when a 
construction contains invalid intersections - in this case, no 
assertions are guaranteed to be valid.) Proofs are verified by an 
automatic method based on linear algebra, which allows students to 
reason about geometry without being overwhelmed by the complexities of 
computer programming or classical logic.</P>
<P>
GRACE presents a consistent framework for experimenting with 
mathematical principles in the context of high schol geometry. GRACE 
introduces two important mathematical concepts: First, the concept of 
formally verifying the correctness of a statement - this idea is at the 
core of classical mathematics. Second, the concept of building an 
operation by combining a sequence of simpler operations - this idea is 
fundamental to computer science.</P>

Getting Started</H3>
<P>
To run GRACE, click on the button below, or execute &quot;<TT>java Grace</TT>&quot; 
at the command line.  (You may want to resize the main window when it appears.)

The best way to learn about the powerful features 
of GRACE is to follow the steps of the tutorial.</P>

<P>
GRACE includes the capability to load libraries from a URL. Due to Java 
security restrictions, you will not be able to load files while running 
in a browser, unless GRACE is set up at a WWW site and the URLs given 
in the applet parameters in the index.html are set correctly. To avoid 
this problem, run the program from the command line, or from the <A

About this Project</H3>
<P>
This software was written at Rice University, under the supervision of 
Joe Warren. GRACE was implemented in Java 1.0.2, but is fully 
compatible with Java 1.1.1. </P>
<P>
<B>Java on IRIX</B>: GRACE sometimes causes a long list of warning 
messages when running on SGI systems; these are bugs in the API. Also, 
windows may appear too small when first opened, and need to be resized. 
These problems do not appear on the other systems that I have tested.</P>
