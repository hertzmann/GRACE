An overview of the mathematics of GRACE </H2>

Rigorous proofs for ruler and compass construction can be very subtle. 
In this section, we give a quick overview of the mathematical framework 
for the proof system used in GRACE. </P>

Constructions</H3>
<P>
The fundamental building block of GRACE is the construction. A 
construction takes some points as inputs, and produces some outputs. 
There may be restrictions on the input shapes, called input 
constraints, that must be met before the construction can be applied. 
The construction may produce shapes as output, constraints as output, 
or both. For instance, the midpoint construction produces the midpoint 
as output, plus a constraint that asserts that the point is halfway 
between the inputs. The term &quot;theorem&quot; refers to a 
construction that produces no output shapes, and &quot;axiom&quot; 
refers to a construction for which no proof is provided. 
&quot;Primitive&quot; refers to an axiom that is built-in to the 
system. (such as &quot;Line&quot; and &quot;Intersect&quot;.) The 
&quot;Intersect&quot; primitive is unique in that it is the only 
construction that may return a variable number of shapes, and it is 
also the only construction that accepts any shape other than points as 
input.</P>

<H3>
Constraints</H3>
<P>
Proofs in GRACE involve constraints, which are symbolic mathematical 
statements regarding the relationship of points. There are two kinds of 
measurements - the distance between two points, and the angle between 
three points. Constraints are expressed as a linear combination of 
measurements with positive integer coefficients. Constraints do not 
include constant terms (except for PI in angle constraints).</P>
<P>
Constraints are created as assumptions, as outputs from constructions, 
and automatically during intersection. (Constructions that use 
intersect may also create automatic constraints.) Any constraint that 
can be expressed as a linear combination of other constraints will also 
be recognized by GRACE as true.</P>
<P>
In the first version of GRACE, measurements may only be in terms of 
points. You cannot, for instance, use the length of a line or the 
distance between two circles. Additionally, construction inputs may 
only be points, and intersections may only produce points. </P>
<H3>
<A NAME="automatic">Constraints from primitive operations </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="automatic">Constructions in GRACE are created from a sequence 
of primitive constructions. These primitive constraints are of two 
types. The &quot;Line&quot;, &quot;Circle, &quot;Line segment&quot;, 
&quot;Ray&quot; and &quot;Complementary ray&quot; constructions take a 
pair of points and create a curve. Points on these curves can be 
characterized by simple distance constraints. For example, a circle 
with center p and containing a point q is the set of all points r such 
that <I>dist(p,q)=dist(p,r)</I>. The line segment with endpoints p and 
q is the set of all points r such that <I>dist(p,r)+dist(r,q)=dist(p,q)</I>. 
GRACE associates such a constraint with each line or circle created. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="automatic">The &quot;Intersection&quot; primitive takes a pair 
of curves, computes their intersection points numerically, and 
instantiates for each point the symbolic distance constraints 
associated with the curves. For example, if an intersection produces 
two new points x and y on a Circle(p,q), then GRACE creates two new 
constraints: <I>dist(p,q)=dist(p,x)</I> and <I>dist(p,q)=dist(p,y)</I>. 
These symbolic constraints are the building blocks for further 
constraints. </A></P>
<H3>
<A NAME="sidedness">Handling sided-ness using rays and line segments </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="sidedness">Traditional ruler and compass constructions (e.g 
Euclid) rely on a static diagram that encodes how the curves in the 
diagram intersect. The diagram also encodes subtle notions of 
sided-ness that are never explicitly stated. GRACE explicitly captures 
sided-ness using the linear primitives, &quot;Ray&quot;, 
&quot;Complementary ray&quot; and &quot;Line segment&quot;. For 
example, &quot;Ray(p,q)&quot; consists of those points r that are on 
the same sided of p as q. Given another point x, GRACE automatically 
treats the expressions <I>angle(x,p,q)</I> and <I>angle(x,p,r)</I> as 
being identical. This type of simplification is usually done without 
comment in traditional proofs. If it is noted, the reader is referred 
to the diagram. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="sidedness">Proofs in GRACE often require a higher level of 
rigor. The user must specify the linear primitive that correctly 
captures the sided-ness necessary in the proof. 
&quot;Complementary_ray(p,q)&quot; consists of those points that are on 
the opposite side of p from q. &quot;Line_segment(p,q)&quot; consists 
of those points that are between p and q. Given this information, GRACE 
is designed to infer the relevant distance constraints from these 
linear primitives automatically. </A></P>
<H3>
<A NAME="failure">Failure of a construction </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="failure">During the definition of a construction, the user may 
perform various intersection operations. The operations may have zero, 
one, or two points as their result depending on the curve primitives 
and geometric location of their input points. As the user drags the 
input points, the number of intersection points may change. Once an 
intersection is specified and its intersection points computed 
numerically, GRACE treats a change in the number of output points as a 
failure of the construction. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="failure">For example, suppose a construction uses the 
intersection of two circles. If these circles fail to intersect, then 
the construction makes little sense and should be viewed as having 
failed. One way of viewing this policy is that the user specifies the 
input configuration consistent with the intent of the construction. 
Radical changes in the location of the input points may result in a 
totally different construction. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="failure">Given a set of input and output constraints 
associated with a construction, a proof in GRACE asserts that if the 
input constraints are satisfied AND the construction succeeds (i.e. 
does not fail), then the output points are guaranteed to satisfy the 
output constraints. Note that proofs in GRACE make no guarantees about 
whether a particular construction succeeds. Proving that a construction 
always succeeds is often beyond the scope of GRACE. </A></P>
