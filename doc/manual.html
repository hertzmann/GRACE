<A NAME="start">To run GRACE, press the button marked &quot;Start 
GRACE&quot;. The program will be downloaded to your computer. Depending

please be patient. A status window will appear to show the progress of 
the download. When it has finished, the GRACE window will appear. </A></P>

<A NAME="libsmenu"><B>Libraries menu</B> </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="libsmenu">The <B>Libraries menu</B> allows the user to load an 
entire library of constructions into GRACE. Several example libraries 
are provided. &quot;Basic&quot; provides simple, commonly-used 
constructions. The remaining example libraries perform advanced 
constructions. The &quot;Basic&quot; library must be loaded before the 
advanced libraries are loaded.</A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="libsmenu"><EM>Enter URL...</EM> may be used to load a library 
from a specific URL. Due to Java security restrictions in most 
browsers, the library may only be loaded from the server that provided 
the Java applet (www.cs.rice.edu). The <EM>Enter library text</EM>
 option may be used to paste or type the text of a library directly 
into a window. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="winmenu"><B>Windows menu</B> </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="winmenu">These options bring up the <B>Text window</B>, the <B>Expressions 
window</B>, and the <B>Constraints window</B> as described below. </A></P>
<H3>
<A NAME="textwin">Text window </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="textwin">This window displays a textual representation of the 
current construction. The top portion displays the names of the input 
points. The middle portion displays the individual steps of the 
construction. The names of the shapes produced by each step are listed 
on the left-hand side of each statement. These tags correspond to the 
&quot;labels&quot; used in the display area. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="textwin">During the course of a construction, several 
coincident geometric primitives may be constructed. When labels 
overlap, GRACE displays the label for only the most recently defined 
shape. Also, when two shapes are near the click, the most recently 
defined shape will be selected. This makes it difficult to select a 
shape that is completely obscured by another shape. To select an 
obscured shape, first click on the statement in the text window that 
defines that shape. The label for that shape will then be displayed and 
the shape can be selected. For instance, in the following sequence of 
steps, shapes P0 and P1 become obscured by I5 and I6: </A></P>
<PRE>

<A NAME="textwin">   P0</A>
<A NAME="textwin">   P1</A>

<A NAME="textwin">   A2 = &quot;Midpoint&quot;(P1,P0)</A>
<A NAME="textwin">   L3 = Line(P0,P1)</A>
<A NAME="textwin">   C4 = Circle(A2,P0)</A>
<A NAME="textwin">   I5 I6 = Intersect(C4,L3)</A>

</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="textwin">Click on P0 or P1 in the Text window to make the 
inputs visible; click on &quot;I5 I6 = Intersect(C4,L3)&quot; to make 
the intersection points visible again. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="textwin">Because Java applets are untrusted, GRACE cannot save 
constructions to a file. However, clicking the &quot;pure text&quot; 
button creates a window containing the actual text representation used 
in GRACE libraries. This text can be copied from the window and saved 
to a file. Several constructions can be saved in the same file, but all 
constructions must be defined before their use. The &quot;Enter 
URL...&quot; option in the &quot;Library&quot; menu can be used to load 
the file. Due to security restrictions, however, most browsers will 
only allow a URL to be loaded from the same site that GRACE came from. 
Alternately, the &quot;Enter library text&quot; option can be used to 
paste the text of the constructions in directly to a window. </A></P>
<H3>
<A NAME="exprwin">Expressions window </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="exprwin">This window allows the user to create expressions 
involving distances and angles with the mouse. The expressions are 
displayed textually and their current values are displayed graphically. 
Dragging input points causes the expressions to be updated 
continuously. Expressions can be used to compare various quantities 
associated with a construction, and are also the building blocks for 
the constraints used in proofs. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="exprwin">The left column of the window displays distance 
expressions, while the right column displays angle expressions. 
Clicking &quot;New Distance&quot; starts the entry of a new distance 
expression. Clicking on a pair of points adds their distance to the 
current distance expression. A similar process allows the creation of 
angle expressions. Expressions using pi (180 degrees) can be created 
using the &quot;Add Pi&quot; button. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="exprwin"><I>dist(A,B)</I> represents the distance between two 
points A and B. <I>angle(A,B,C)</I> represents the angle ABC. (The apex 
is at B.) </A></P>
<H3>
<A NAME="contswin">Constraints window </A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="contswin">A constraint is an equation involving a pair of 
expressions. Constraints can be used to characterize the behavior of a 
ruler and compass construction. For example, a constraint can express 
that the sum of the angles in a triangle is Pi. The constraint window 
allows the user to create, manipulate and display constraints 
associated with a construction. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="contswin">GRACE supports three types of constraints: </A></P>
<DL>
    <DT>
    <A NAME="contswin"><EM>Input constraints </EM></A>
    <DD>
    <A NAME="contswin">Input constraints describe the relationships 
    between the input points to a ruler and compass construction. The 
    &quot;create input&quot; button allows the user to specify input 
    constraints during a construction. Before applying the construction, 
    GRACE symbolically verifies that the input points satisfy all input 
    constraints. However, GRACE does not require the construction to 
    satisfy input constraints during its definition. (Note this does not 
    affect the validity of the construction and proof.) </A>
    <DT>
    <A NAME="contswin"><EM>Intermediate constraints </EM></A>
    <DD>
    <A NAME="contswin">These constraints relate angles and distances 
    produced during intermediate step of the construction. Typically, these 
    constraints are derived from input constraints using axioms and other 
    user defined constructions. The &quot;test intermediate&quot; button 
    allows the user to test symbolically whether a particular intermediate 
    constraint is true. </A>
    <P>
    <A NAME="contswin">The user can also create additional axioms using 
    the &quot;Force intermediate&quot; button. GRACE adds the constraint to 
    the current set of valid constraints without any further symbolic 
    checking. Constructions that use forced constraints should be 
    considered axioms, not proofs. </A></P>
    <DT>
    <A NAME="contswin"><EM>Output constraints </EM></A>
    <DD>
    <A NAME="contswin">These constraints relate input primitives to 
    output primitives. They are those constraints produced by applying a 
    construction. The &quot;Create output&quot; buttons allows the user to 
    select an intermediate constraints (or create a new constraint) and add 
    it to the set of output constraints. </A>
</DL>
<P>
<A NAME="contswin">GRACE displays the current set of known constraints 
in the constraint window. Each constraint is preceded by the number of 
the construction that produced the constraint. The tag &quot;F&quot; 
means the constraint was forced with the &quot;Force constraint&quot; 
command. The tag &quot;A&quot; means that the system automatically 
generated the constraint. A new constraint is true if it can be 
expressed as a linear combination of existing constraints. GRACE uses 
linear algebra to do this test automatically. </A></P>
